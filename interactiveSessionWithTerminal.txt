Docker Target
For modules that use a Docker target, the instance will take the form of http://<ip>:port> after spawning, i.e. 
http://157.245.40.149:30655. Once this image spawns, you can choose to interact with it from the provided Pwnbox, 
your own VM, etc. Docker images will typically spawn more quickly than VMs. Click on Click here to spawn the target 
system! to spawn the target Docker image.

Modules that have either a Windows target, Active Directory (AD) environment, require multiple hosts, 
or otherwise cannot be completed using a Docker image will have an accompanying VM or set of VMs. You can click to spawn
 this target the same way. If the target VM requires authentication, you will be provided with credentials to 
authenticate via SSH. WinRM, RDP, etc. If you are not provided with credentials, it is safe to assume that you
 must attack the target from an unauthenticated standpoint unless otherwise instructed. If you choose to 
interact with the target via the Pwnbox, you will be automatically connected to the Academy lab VPN once the 
Pwnbox and target VM are spawned.
